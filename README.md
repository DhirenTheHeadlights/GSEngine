### Style Guide

The files in this project are divided into the following categories:

- `src` - Contains all the source code for the project
- `assets` - Contains all the assets for the project
- `include` - Contains all the header files for the project

These are the major categories of files in the `src` & `include` directory:

- `GameLayer` - Contains all the game logic
- `Platform` - Contains all the platform specific code (e.g. OS, Windowing, Input, etx.)
- `Engine` - Contains all the engine specific code

These are two big things to avoid when writing code for this project:

- Avoid inheritance when possible
- Avoid using pointers when possible
